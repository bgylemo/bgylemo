Welcome to my GitHub! <br />
I am a PhD student in Colm Nestors research group at Link√∂ping University, Sweden, working on X-chromosome biology.<br />
I primarily work with developing data preprocessing and analysis pipelines for whole-exome/genome sequencing data, RNA-seq data and DNA methylation array data. I have worked with processing and analysing said data either on its own or in an integrated manner (e.g. extensive experience in allele-specific expression analysis where you intergrate heterozygous SNP calls with RNA-seq data to quantify reads separately for each allele).	<br />

Also, I have recently made my way into scRNA-seq data analysis, including 10X and smart-seq2 data.

Bioinformatic areas I'm currently exploring involves long read sequencing data analysis (for lots of different applications) and analysis of WGBS data.
