Welcome to my GitHub. 
I am a PhD student in Colm Nestors research group at Link√∂ping University, Sweden, working with X-chromosome inactivation biology.	
Although I'm a wet lab medical biologist by education, my primary research focus has been devloping data preprocessing and analysis of whole-exome, whole-genome and RNA sequencing data.	
Previous work includes investigating X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in thymocyte development as well as in multiple other human tissues.	
I would like to learn more about data analysis and visualization as well as further my knowledge in how the X-chromosome works, in both humans and other species.
