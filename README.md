Welcome to my GitHub. 
I am a PhD student in Colm Nestors research group at Link√∂ping University, Sweden, working with X-chromosome biology.<br />
Although I'm a wet lab medical biologist by education, I have primarily been devloping data preprocessing and analysis pipelines for whole-exome/genome sequencing data, RNA-seq data and DNA methylation array data. I have worked with processing and analysing said data either on its own or in an integrated manner (For example, I have extensive experience in allele-specific expression analysis where you intergrate heterozygous SNP calls with RNA-seq data to quantify reads separately for each allele).	<br />

I would like to strengthen my bioinformatics toolbox, learn more about data analysis and visualization as well as further my knowledge in how the X-chromosome works, in both humans and other species.
